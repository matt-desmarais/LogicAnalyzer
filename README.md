pi + rainbowhat + touchscreen + usb sound card (mic or aux in) + open ai = audio logic analyzer
I want to make use of the three capacitive touch buttons and their corresponding leds

It will listen for speech, when speech stops (or paused) it will analyze what was said with whisper+gpt3.5turbo, it will display # of LF on the display, leds represent how much of what was said was fallacious and it will print its explanationson the touch screen.

## If no fallacies are found
